# Fetch Data Analytics Coding Excercise
Rithvik Mandumula

#### Excercise Status: [Completed]

## Requirements and Purpose
1. Create a new structured relational data model diagram 
2. Write SQL querys against my new structured relational data model that answers questions from a business stakeholder.
3. Share an noteworthy/interesting observation with a non-technical stakeholder

### Technologies
* Python
* SQL
* Pandas
* PandaSQL
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebooks

## Steps/Materials needed to run/view this project on another PC/Device
1. Install Jupyter Notebooks(https://jupyter.org/install)
2. Open the notebook and install The neccesary packages/libraries(Pandas, Pandasql, and Matplotlib) by running the first couple cells
3. Run other cells to view the rest of the project


## Why did I choose Jupyter Notebooks and a Python Environment?
Firstly, I chose to work in a Python environment as that is the language I have been using the most recently and am most comfortable with at the moment. For all my
previous data scienceand analytics work, I had used python librarys such as Pandas and Numpy. This led to me do some initial research before I started coding to see
if it was possible to run SQL Query's in a Python environment and this is when I stumbled upon PandaSQL. PandaSql allowed to me to query pandas dataframes and this gave me 
clarity on what I planned to do. 

Lastly, I chose to work with Jupyter Notebooks as I felt it was the best way to present the information that I am finding through my analysis 
to a business or non-technical stakeholder which was one of the requirements. Working with Jupyter Notebooks allows me to combine my code with headings/subtitles and text which can make my 
technical coding project look more like a business presentation which can make it easier for people of different backgrounds to understand what I am doing.
